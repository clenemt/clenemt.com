Before the Typescript era, users had to resort to online documentation for guidance. {.lead}

In those dark age, it was common to **squint** at [tiny]{.fs-small} fonts and confusing UIs to find out what your function was supposed to return.

[Docdash](https://github.com/clenemt/docdash) is an answer to that problem. It brings clear left menu navigation, consistent UI and _great typography_ to [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).
