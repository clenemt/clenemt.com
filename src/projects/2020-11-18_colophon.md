This site is built using a number of **third party** tools and services. {.lead}

Produced using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), my editor of choice for the past 2 years, built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Font files are delivered through Google Fonts:

* [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) by Cyreal
* [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic

Other notable tools are:

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for assets bundling
* [@11ty/eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) for creating the responsive images
