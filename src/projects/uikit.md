Living style guides are to front-end what well thought APIs are to backend. Essentials.

They are designed to aid in building **well-organized** documentation of front-end codebases. They details all the various elements and coded modules of a site or application.

Dassault Systèmes needed to **unify its UI/UX patterns** and consolidate its front-end code. Furthermore they needed to document the _visual language_, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create their applications. It was a **one-stop place** for the entire team from product owners and producers to designers and developers to reference when discussing site changes and iterations.

## Iterations

The term _"living"_ means its an **ever-going process**.

In the course of **3+** years I iterated over a style guide and delivered not less then three versions.

### Version 1.0 (2014){.small}

{% image "uikit-v1.jpg","The copycat intro" %}

{% image "uikit-v1-js.jpg", "The Ext JS approach to components" %}

### Version 2.0 (2015){.small}

{% image "uikit-v2.jpg", "Rethinking the hierarchy and usage" %}

{% image "uikit-v2-js.jpg", "Buttons need buttons" %}

### Version 3.0 (2016){.small}

{% image "uikit-v3-home.jpg", "The new home for version 3" %}

{% image "uikit-v3.jpg", "Better colors and documentation" %}

{% image "uikit-v3-js.jpg", "A more bootstrapy way to approach components" %}

## Final thoughts

This work helped me grasp some of the issues inherent to style guides:

- releasing to early
- not involving all parties
- handling breaking changes

Some of them are described in this [Smashing article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/creating-a-living-style-guide-case-study/).
