## How a living style guide came to be

Living style guides are to front-end what well thought APIs are to backend. Essentials.{.lead}

They are designed to aid in building **well-organized** documentation of front-end codebases. They details all the various elements and coded modules of a site or application.

Dassault Systèmes needed to **unify its UI/UX patterns** and consolidate its front-end code. Furthermore they needed to document the _visual language_, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create their applications. It was a **one-stop place** for the entire team from product owners and producers to designers and developers to reference when discussing site changes and iterations.

## Iterations

The term _"living"_ means its an **ever-going process**.

In the course of **3+** years I iterated over this style guide and delivered not less then three versions.

### Version 1.0 [(2014)]{.fs-small .fw-normal}

The first iteration was heavily inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/) since it was the only style guide out there at the time.

Components usage was similar to [ExtJs](https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/3.4.0/) library with a `Class` based approach.

### Version 2.0 [(2015)]{.fs-small .fw-normal}

With version 2.0 we split the library into Javascript and CSS components to make navigation easier.

Additionally, every components would have it's own documentation page for easier referencing.

### Version 3.0 [(2016)]{.fs-small .fw-normal}

The focus here was on clarity and quality. New documentations guides and examples were added.

Design tokens and utilities classes were a nice way to speed up development.

## Final thoughts

This work helped me grasp some of the issues inherent to style guides:

- Releasing to early
- Not involving all parties
- Maintaining a growing user base
- Handling breaking changes
