## Floriane et ClÃ©ment vont-ils partir?

Moving away from a beloved place is never easy. This website made it easier for us. {.lead}

Back in January we decided to go on with the original plan of **crossing Canada**. But before we could check it off the list we had a bit of a situation with our house furniture. Two years of compulsive buying on [Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) had left a big pile of stuff in our home.

Fortunately for us we had a big network, through both of our jobs, and a bunch of friends that where willing to take on some of it. The only thing missing was a way for everyone to buy our stuff.

We could have posted adds for everything we were willing to part with, but where's **the fun** in that?

Hence [florianeetclementvontilspartir.com](https://florianeetclementvontilspartir.com/) was born.

This website is build with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses [global data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) for the list of articles and a custom email for managing the buyers.

It seems like it worked out quite well since we sold 95% of our stuff ðŸ˜‚.

Thanks to [Floriane](https://florianejacqueneau.com/) for the design work and the custom icons.
