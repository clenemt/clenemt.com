## Jackal

[Jackal](https://github.com/clenemt/jackal) is a very lightweight theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a simplistic design.{.lead}

Jackal stemmed from the redesign of this website. Going through the quirks of setting up a new website with Jekyll was enough for me to open source this starter template.

It features a straightforward home page, an about page, pagination, articles pages, portfolio section, RSS feed and responsive & great looking typography.

Jackal is cruft free meaning you get what you asked for and nothing more. Perfect for folks who just need a starter theme to work from.
