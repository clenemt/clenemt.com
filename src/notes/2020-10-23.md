If you ever need to **remap your bash shortcuts** (advance word, kill word, kill line...) you might struggle to find the correct key sequence. From this [stack exchange answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/76566/where-do-i-find-a-list-of-terminal-key-codes-to-remap-shortcuts-in-bash/76591#76591), paste the following `sed -n l` in bash, press your key sequence, then <kbd>enter</kbd>. You can also use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>, but it might not show all keys.

**Tips**: To see all your bindings type `bind -P`
