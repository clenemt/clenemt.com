If you are like me you are probably **serving your fonts** from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Why? Because it is one less thing to worry about when making websites (font rendering, [font subsets](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#specifying_script_subsets), [unicode range](https://caniuse.com/font-unicode-range), [font variants](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2), font display, font discovery...).

In addition to those nifty features and sensible defaults, it was common knowledge that using Google fonts **would leverage the speed and cache** of their CDN. Sadly the caching argument is **not true anymore**.

> Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts canâ€™t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).

This feature was added to prevent some [cross-site tracking mechanism](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning) like:

* detect if a user has visited a specific site
* detect if a user has search for some special terms
* track a user through multiple sites

Now is the time to [say goodbye to Google Fonts](https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/) ðŸ‘‹
