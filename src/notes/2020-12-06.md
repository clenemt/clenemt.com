It seems Firefox will ship with `:focus-visible` support [in v85](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1445482).
Chrome has been [supporting it](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/09/chrome-86-improved-focus-highlighting.html) since September.

It will allow us to remove the button <span style="outline: 2px dotted gray">outline</span> appearing when clicked without removing it for users who rely on it for accessibility.

```css
/* Hide focus when button receives focus via mouse */
button:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: 0;
}

/* Show focus only for keyboard users */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 5px solid red;  
}
```

But as pointed out by [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/#one-step-forward-one-step-back), we should still avoid using it since it requires a polyfill for other/older browsers and therefore adds more code and complexity to our bundles.

Plus we already have a solution for that. It's called **Accessible Design** and it includes designing those focus states to be part of the website experience.

All hail the wide supported `:focus`.
