Everyone knows flexbox by now. But if like me, you only used the shorthand approach of `display: flex` then [this article is for you](https://medium.com/@tiffnogueira/understanding-flex-shrink-flex-grow-and-flex-basis-and-using-these-properties-to-their-full-e4b4afd2c930). It goes in great details about `flex-shrink`, `flex-grow` but also the lesser known `flex-basis`. Worth a read.
