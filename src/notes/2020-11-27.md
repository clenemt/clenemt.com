Today I had some free time and cleaned up my file explorer and right click menu. It feels good to **debloat** your daily OS. I am now experimenting with this [alternative file explorer](https://github.com/files-community/Files). Will report on it later if needs be.

**Tips**: to remove "unremovable" item from the sidebar, search in regedit for the string `IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree` and change its value to `0` where needed (Dropbox, iCloud, Adobe...).
