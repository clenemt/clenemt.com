Today I joined the CSS Grid hype train. Yeah, I'm late. But hear me out.

I've been using `float` for a long time before I moved to `flex`. When you find such a malleable tool, it's hard to try out new things as almost all layouts can be achieved with `flex`. But using `grid`, as I found out, allows you to write way less code. **Bye Bye** most of my `@media` queries and **Hello** `auto-fill` and `repeat`.
