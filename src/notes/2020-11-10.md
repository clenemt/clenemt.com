[Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/) released last month and I just had time to peak at the changelog. With it comes a new **Assets module** that remove the need for custom loaders like `file-loader`. There is a small satisfaction to removing dependencies from your `package.json` isn't it?
