Today is the 1<sup>st</sup> of December. It is also the day I discovered [Privatezilla](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla). A sweet tool for a quick **privacy and security check** of your Windows 10.

No more googling how to remove default apps, disabling Cortana, deleting OneDrive, blocking telemetry...

I'll try to make this December the _"improve my setup"_ month.
