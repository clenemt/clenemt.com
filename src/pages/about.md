# I am a frontend architect.

For the past **5+ years** I've worked at [Dassault Systemes](http://www.3ds.com/fr/) as a _full stack_ developer with a **UX/UI** driven background and a user centered approach. {.lead}

I aim to create products that make users and clients happy. True care for quality and web standards is what has always motivated me, so I approach work through _progressive enhancement_.

I like simple solutions to complex problems.

## Design and development

While my main skills are in frontend architecture, my mindset is that of a designer. I like to come up with **simple and friendly ways** for a user to achieve the task. Good design I believe, is _invisible_.

This translates in frontend development to _responsible_ responsive design. It’s not just about adapting to screen sizes, but also the browser, network conditions, usage context, accessibility and more.

## Technical skillset

I’m extremely fluent with CSS and its **preprocessors** (Sass, LESS, PostCSS). I’m familiar with task runners, bundlers and CI servers (Grunt, Webpack, Jenkins, Travis), content management systems (WordPress, Jekyll) and project planning software (Trello, Gitlab, Redmine).

**Web performance** is very important to me. I find performance budgets to be _key_ for a good frontend architecture. I understand the waterfall, how browser requests work and how to optimize the above-the-fold content, with caching, conditional loading and asset optimization.

JavaScript new trends are something I follow closely. I'm able to keep up thanks to a myriad of web feeds that I'll gladly share. I like diving deep into established framework and learn more about the _underlining_ concepts.

With some background on back-end development, I have experience with PHP, Java and C/C++, so I can pick up any programming language or library quickly. I’ve also worked with plenty of **RESTful** APIs.

Well documented APIs are to backend what styleguides are to frontend.
