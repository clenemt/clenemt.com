# [Hello Iâ€™m Clement]{.page__title-pre .fw-bold} a frontend architect.{.page__title}

I'm also a [writer](notes/) and [definitely not]{.select-hide .select-hide--2} professional climber.

I like [building](projects/work/) stuffs and [experimenting](projects/open-source/) with [strange things]{.select-hide .select-hide--1}.

I'm [full on]{.select-hide .select-hide--3} passionate about my craft, always looking out for _original ideas_. I'm drawn to anything that involves hiking, climbing or travelling.
