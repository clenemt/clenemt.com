For the past 5+ years I've worked at Dassault Systemes as a *full stack* developer with a UX/UI driven background and a user centered approach.

I aim to create products that make users and clients happy. True care for quality and web standards is what has always motivated me, so I approach work through *progressive enhancement*.

I like **simple solutions** to complex problems.

While my main skills are in frontend architecture, my mindset is that of a designer. I like to come up with simple and friendly ways for a user to achieve the task. Good design I believe, is *invisible*. It’s when you can’t think of a product in any other, better way when you’ve achieved good design.

This translates in frontend development to *responsible* responsive design. Years ago I realized it’s not just about adapting to screen sizes, but also the browser, network conditions, ways the device is being used, accessibility and more.

# Technical skillset
I’m extremely fluent with CSS preprocessors (Sass, LESS). I’m familiar with task runners and CI servers (Grunt, Webpack, Jekyll, Travis), content management systems (WordPress, Jekyll) and project planning software (Trello, Gitlab, Redmine).

Web performance is very important to me. I find performance budgets to be *key* for a good frontend architecture. I understand the waterfall, how browser requests work and how to optimize the above-the-fold content, with caching, conditional loading and asset optimization.

JavaScript new trends are something I follow closely, and I am able to keep up thanks to a myriad of web feeds that i gladly share.

With some background on back-end development, I have experience with PHP, Java and C/C++, so I can pick up any programming language or library quickly. I’ve also worked with plenty of RESTful APIs.

Well documented APIs are to backend what styleguides are to frontend.
