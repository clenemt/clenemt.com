  <p>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Clement Moron</strong>, a <a href="/about/">frontend architect</a>, <a href="/articles/">writer</a> and wall climber based in Paris, France. I work as a nexus between   design and frontend, <a href="/work/">making websites</a> scalable and lightning-fast.</p>

  <p>I like to build useful <a href="/projects/">side projects</a> in my spare time, to improve either my skills or my workflow.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in design systems, cinema, languages, philosophy and traditional crafts, like the japanese <a href="https://youtu.be/lT55_u8URU0"><em>kintsugi</em></a>.</p>
